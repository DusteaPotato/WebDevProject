          <h2>Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 2</h2>
            <img src="assets/comg1.png">
            <p>Become MEGA in Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 4 Season 2. Ride the grind rails of “MEGA City” and swerve on its streets on a sports bike. Go beyond the neon towers to the rest of the new biome: cause Havoc at “Steamy Springs,” drive a Neon Drifter to the "Drift Ridge" car track, sharpen your Kinetic Blade skills at “Kenjutsu Crossing,” and more!
                Look mega good with Chapter 4 Season 2’s Battle Pass Outfits. With the Chapter 4 Season 2 Battle Pass purchase, you’ll auto-unlock the fine-tailored Renzo the Destroyer. Progress through the Battle Pass to unlock other Outfits, including the streetwear savant Thunder, the elegantly casual Highwire, and more.
                You can earn XP towards your Battle Pass in Battle Royale and Zero Build. But did you know you can also earn XP in certain creator-made games? Creator-made games that reward XP have an XP badge in their Discover screen description. Play the way you want to unlock Thunder, Mystica, the adrift “Stray,” and more!</p>
            <p><b>Play Your Way!</b></p>
            <p>Sprint, climb, and smash your way to a Victory Royale whether you choose to build up in Fortnite Battle Royale or go no-builds in the new Fortnite Zero Build.</p>
            <p><b>Take the offensive in Fortnite Zero Build No Build Battle Royale</b></p>
            <p>Introducing a new, tactical take on Fortnite Battle Royale with the launch of Fortnite Zero Build. Show off your sharp shooting, sharp thinking, and sharp sense of space as you take on the Battle full-tilt in Fortnite Zero Build.
                Without building, all players have the recharging Overshield as their first line of defense in Zero Build. Slide downhill to avoid enemy fire or use mantling to get the high ground on opponents. Don’t forget to sprint between cover on your way to a Victory Royale!</p>
            <p><b>Zero Build is a pure test of weapon, item, and traversal skill - no building required.</b></p>
            <p>Zero Build is a pure test of weapon, item, and traversal ability. Zero Build can be found in the Discover page as Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads playlists. (Access the Discover page by clicking on the “CHANGE” button above “PLAY!” in the Lobby.)
                Fortnite Zero Build shares XP progression and Quests with Fortnite Battle Royale, meaning you can earn XP towards your Battle Pass in either Fortnite Zero Build or Fortnite Battle Royale. Take on a new challenge and level up along the way!</p>
