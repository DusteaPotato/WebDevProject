          <h2>CALL OF DUTY: WARZONE</h2>
            <img src="assets/codm.png">
            <p>Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by Activision. Starting out in 2003, it first focused on games set in World War II. Over time, the series has seen games set in the midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and the modern day. The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then also by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers. The most recent title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, was released on October 28, 2022.</p>
            <p><b>Play Your Way!</b></p>
            <p>Sprint, climb, and smash your way to a Victory Royale whether you choose to build up in Fortnite Battle Royale or go no-builds in the new Fortnite Zero Build.</p>
            <p><b>Take the offensive in Fortnite Zero Build No Build Battle Royale</b></p>
            <p>Introducing a new, tactical take on Fortnite Battle Royale with the launch of Fortnite Zero Build. Show off your sharp shooting, sharp thinking, and sharp sense of space as you take on the Battle full-tilt in Fortnite Zero Build.
                Without building, all players have the recharging Overshield as their first line of defense in Zero Build. Slide downhill to avoid enemy fire or use mantling to get the high ground on opponents. Don’t forget to sprint between cover on your way to a Victory Royale!</p>
            <p><b>Zero Build is a pure test of weapon, item, and traversal skill - no building required.</b></p>
            <p>Zero Build is a pure test of weapon, item, and traversal ability. Zero Build can be found in the Discover page as Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads playlists. (Access the Discover page by clicking on the “CHANGE” button above “PLAY!” in the Lobby.)
                Fortnite Zero Build shares XP progression and Quests with Fortnite Battle Royale, meaning you can earn XP towards your Battle Pass in either Fortnite Zero Build or Fortnite Battle Royale. Take on a new challenge and level up along the way!</p>
