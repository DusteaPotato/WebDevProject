          <p>Grand Theft Auto V (also known as Grand Theft Auto Five, GTA 5, GTAV, and Grand Theft Auto V: Story Mode[3]) is a video game developed by Rockstar North. It is the fifteenth instalment in the Grand Theft Auto series and the fifth game title in the HD Universe of the series.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h2><b>Latest Update!</b></h2>
          <h2>GTA V</h2>
            <img src="assets/comg6.png">
            <p>As one of the most eagerly-awaited video game titles to be released in 2013, the game was widely anticipated prior to its release. Grand Theft Auto V was released to universal acclaim, holding scores of 96 and above on MetaCritic and GameRankings, as well as receiving perfect scores from over 30 reviewers. The game sold 11,210,000 copies and grossed $800,000,000 on its first day of release, setting many records, eventually making $1,000,000,000 within 3 days of the game's release.</p>
            <p><b>Cross Play</b></p>
            <p>Currently, GTA 5 does not offer crossplay across consoles or PC for the single-player game or GTA 5 Online. With the new version of GTA 5 releasing soon for Xbox Series X|S and PS5, crossplay might be a possibility, but Rockstar has not confirmed this.</p>
            <p><b>Cross-Save</b></p>
            <p>At this time, GTA 5 does not have a cross-save feature. This means that if you play on PS4 you will need to start the game over again if you move to Xbox One. There has been no news yet on whether or not cross-save will be available when GTA 5 is released on Xbox Series X|S or PS5.</p>
            <p><b>The GTA V Universe</b></p>
            <p>GTA V is set in the city of Los Santos and Blaine County, in the fictional state of San Andreas. Like previous GTA titles, GTA V has a set story that must be completed, but outside of that, it is completely open-world. There are plenty of vehicles to steal, weapons to buy, and havok to wreak.</p>
